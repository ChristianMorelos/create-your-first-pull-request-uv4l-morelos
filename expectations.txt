This will be my favorite course together with CMSC 127 
as I would learn to not only build full stack projects but also deploy them. 
This will help me in getting internship opportunities 
as I can add skills I learned here on my resume.

Namata:
I agree that CMSC 100 and CMSC 127 will help us create full stack projects.
We can also definitely broaden our skillset, and use them in our future endeavors.
